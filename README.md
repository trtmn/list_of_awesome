# My Curated List 🎯

> A personal collection of things I love and recommend - software, products, tools, and resources that have made a difference in my life.

## 📝 Rules for Future Updates

### Anchor Link Formatting
When creating anchor links for section headers:
1. **Remove emojis** from the anchor text
2. **Convert spaces to dashes** between emoji and text
3. **Keep emojis in visible headers** for visual appeal

**Examples:**
- "📱 Communication" → `#-communication`
- "👨🏼‍💻 Development" → `#-development`
- "🎮 Games" → `#-games`
- "💻 Hardware" → `#-hardware`
- "🛎️ Services" → `#-services`
