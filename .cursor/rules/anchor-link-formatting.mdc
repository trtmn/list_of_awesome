# Anchor Link Formatting Rules

When creating anchor links for section headers that contain emojis, follow these rules:

## Core Principles

1. **Remove emojis** from the anchor text
2. **Convert spaces to dashes** between emoji and text
3. **Keep emojis in visible headers** for visual appeal

## Examples

| Header Text | Anchor Link |
|-------------|-------------|
| "📱 Communication" | `#-communication` |
| "👨🏼‍💻 Development" | `#-development` |
| "🎮 Games" | `#-games` |
| "💻 Hardware" | `#-hardware` |
| "🛎️ Services" | `#-services` |

## Why This Pattern?

- **GitHub Compatibility**: GitHub's markdown renderer doesn't handle emojis in anchor links properly
- **Space Handling**: Spaces between emojis and text need to be converted to dashes for valid HTML anchors
- **Visual Appeal**: Emojis remain visible in headers while maintaining functional navigation

## Implementation

When updating [README.md](mdc:README.md) or other markdown files:

1. Check if section headers contain emojis
2. Create anchor links by removing emojis and converting spaces to dashes
3. Update Table of Contents to use the correct anchor format
4. Test links to ensure they work properly on GitHub

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ `#📱-communication` (keeping emoji in anchor)
- ❌ `#communication` (missing dash for space)
- ✅ `#-communication` (correct format)
